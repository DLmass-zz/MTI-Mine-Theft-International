2014.05.06 23:12:27 [G] northerwood: Good :D
2014.05.06 23:12:43 [G] DLmass: Well, this is the spawn that got built by me.
2014.05.06 23:12:54 [G] northerwood: Looks nice :D
2014.05.06 23:13:38 [G] DLmass: It's important to give the players a nice introduction when they join for the first time.
2014.05.06 23:13:55 [G] northerwood: Yep lol
2014.05.06 23:14:24 [G] DLmass: ok
2014.05.06 23:14:58 [G] DLmass: This is a ''hardcore'' server that allows PvP, Raiding and Griefing.
2014.05.06 23:15:06 [G] DLmass: I've always wanted a server like that.
2014.05.06 23:15:22 [G] northerwood: Yeah lol
2014.05.06 23:15:29 [G] northerwood: I think they are the best :D
2014.05.06 23:15:42 [G] DLmass: So I need really mature and responsible staff that can watch the server.
2014.05.06 23:15:55 [G] DLmass: Keep an eye*
2014.05.06 23:16:00 [G] northerwood: Ok lol
2014.05.06 23:16:36 [G] DLmass: I did a lookup on your name and I saw you have no past ban history. That is really good.
2014.05.06 23:16:51 [G] northerwood: Yep lol
2014.05.06 23:17:08 [G] DLmass: Are you interested in this position?
2014.05.06 23:17:16 [G] northerwood: Yeah of course! :D
2014.05.06 23:17:39 [G] DLmass: Alright. How many hours per day can you be active?
2014.05.06 23:18:06 [G] northerwood: Well right now I have until 9 my time which it's 4 for me
2014.05.06 23:18:25 [G] DLmass: oh ok
2014.05.06 23:18:30 [G] northerwood: So like 2-4 hours
2014.05.06 23:18:39 [G] DLmass: That enough for me.
2014.05.06 23:18:54 [G] northerwood: Ok lol
2014.05.06 23:18:58 [G] DLmass: There will probably come players online soon so we will have loads of job to do.
2014.05.06 23:19:07 [G] northerwood: Alright, sounds fun :D
2014.05.06 23:19:20 [G] DLmass: Not today tho. I haven't advertised the server yet!
2014.05.06 23:19:27 [G] northerwood: XD
2014.05.06 23:19:44 [G] DLmass: I still need the domain that one of the founders are going to buy.
2014.05.06 23:19:53 [G] northerwood: Ok
2014.05.06 23:20:01 [G] DLmass: We also need to fix the theme on the forum and setup different ranks there.
2014.05.06 23:20:04 [G] DLmass: Follow me
2014.05.06 23:20:06 [G] northerwood: Ok
2014.05.06 23:21:01 [G] DLmass: Spawn is obviously protected :P
2014.05.06 23:21:06 [G] northerwood: Yeah lol
2014.05.06 23:21:15 [G] DLmass: so you have to walk a little bit before being able to build
2014.05.06 23:21:39 [G] DLmass: We don't want houses near spawn due to lag. So someone have to take care of that.

2014.05.10 04:22:33 [G] northerwood: Ok so chests aren't affected lol
2014.05.10 04:22:52 [G] DLmass: They would need to destroy them.

2014.05.10 04:23:06 [G] northerwood: Yep
2014.05.10 04:23:34 [G] northerwood: But yeah your right... Should we allow fire-spread? It could literally burn everything... If people
2014.05.10 04:23:39 [G] northerwood: are stupid enough to do that
2014.05.10 04:23:48 [G] DLmass: Peoples are stupid enough to do that.
2014.05.10 04:23:53 [G] DLmass: It causes lag and shit.
2014.05.10 04:24:05 [G] northerwood: Yeah... So it's a no then xD

2014.05.10 04:25:39 [G] DLmass: yeah
2014.05.10 04:25:43 [G] northerwood: They could ruin someone's life :)

2014.05.10 05:21:57 [G] DLmass: ./warn Name Reason

2014.05.13 18:17:17 [G] sirjoot: Do you have a proper factions plugin?
2014.05.13 18:17:26 [G] DLmass: I haven't added that yet
2014.05.13 18:18:03 [G] sirjoot: Right, well, link me to which ever one you want and I could improve it :D
2014.05.13 18:18:12 [G] sirjoot: I don't feel like going from scratch
2014.05.13 18:18:43 [G] DLmass: I should really move over to windows before doing anything :P
2014.05.13 18:18:50 [G] sirjoot: Probably :P
2014.05.13 18:19:40 [G] DLmass: Anything you would like to change? :)
2014.05.13 18:20:00 [G] sirjoot: I don't think so, we could find a builder to improve things
2014.05.13 18:20:30 [G] DLmass: Alrighty!
2014.05.13 18:22:20 [G] DLmass: Btw, I also have mysql based bans. I found it from bukkit site
2014.05.13 18:22:26 [G] sirjoot: Cool
2014.05.13 18:22:39 [G] DLmass: BanManager. It's really useful for logging and etc.
2014.05.13 18:22:43 [G] sirjoot: Yeah
2014.05.13 18:23:11 [G] DLmass: I'm that type of person that sucks at explaining. I just prefer to stay in the background and pay
2014.05.13 18:23:14 [G] DLmass: for shit!
2014.05.13 18:23:18 [G] sirjoot: ;)
2014.05.13 18:23:38 [G] DLmass: Well. That's why we have no players.
2014.05.13 18:23:49 [G] sirjoot: Do the other owners do anything?
2014.05.13 18:23:55 [G] DLmass: Not really.
2014.05.13 18:24:01 [G] DLmass: I made everything.
2014.05.13 18:24:11 [G] sirjoot: Why'd you keep them?
2014.05.13 18:24:28 [G] DLmass: idk actually. Maybe I'm to friendly to kick them?
2014.05.13 18:24:38 [G] sirjoot: :/
2014.05.13 18:25:08 [G] sirjoot: Where did you find them?
2014.05.13 18:25:10 [G] DLmass: I'm way to friendly but also strict at the same time. I want work to be done. But where the hell
2014.05.13 18:25:15 [G] DLmass: is the inspiration?
2014.05.13 18:25:30 [G] sirjoot: :/
2014.05.13 18:25:54 [G] DLmass: I'm always thinking: Is it really worth it? will we get players?
2014.05.13 18:26:19 [G] DLmass: Only successful server I've had was like 2 years ago.
2014.05.13 18:26:19 [G] sirjoot: It's hard, because there are a LOT of servers out there
2014.05.13 18:26:25 [G] DLmass: exactly.
2014.05.13 18:26:33 [G] sirjoot: What do you have thats special or different
2014.05.13 18:27:04 [G] DLmass: I want to build something new. Something mc players will like
2014.05.13 18:27:23 [G] sirjoot: What about a survival/raid RPG?
2014.05.13 18:27:32 [G] DLmass: I'm up for anything!
2014.05.13 18:27:56 [G] sirjoot: What I am thinking is to have the same sort of PVP/raid/faction thing
2014.05.13 18:28:07 [G] sirjoot: But make it hard and add an RPG aspect
2014.05.13 18:28:21 [G] sirjoot: By allowing people to build Villages that are safe.
2014.05.13 18:28:35 [G] DLmass: Trust me players would love that!
2014.05.13 18:28:37 [G] sirjoot: But mobs are much harder to kill
2014.05.13 18:28:40 [G] sirjoot: etc
2014.05.13 18:28:48 [G] sirjoot: Should we do that?
2014.05.13 18:28:53 [G] DLmass: Yes.
2014.05.13 18:29:03 [G] sirjoot: Lets do it then :)
2014.05.13 18:29:10 [G] DLmass: Alright!
2014.05.13 18:29:22 [G] sirjoot: I have a couple friends who could help build/admin
2014.05.13 18:29:31 [G] sirjoot: Who LOVE RPG's too ;)
2014.05.13 18:29:44 [G] DLmass: Perfect! :D
2014.05.13 18:30:15 [G] DLmass: I have one admin here I'd like to keep tho
2014.05.13 18:30:23 [G] sirjoot: So, put it on Windows, make a new map (find one till we find one we like) and build a castle or some
2014.05.13 18:30:27 [G] sirjoot: Thats obv fine :P
2014.05.13 18:30:30 [G] sirjoot: *something

2014.05.13 18:31:03 [G] DLmass: Yeah. Backup map :)
2014.05.13 18:31:18 [G] DLmass: I've also had an idea for a long time.
2014.05.13 18:31:26 [G] sirjoot: Mhm?
2014.05.13 18:31:41 [G] DLmass: Players can donate for islands. I don't know it it fits our theme or not.
2014.05.13 18:32:03 [G] sirjoot: Maybe they can donate for a village?
2014.05.13 18:32:13 [G] DLmass: Sounds better actually xD
2014.05.13 18:32:26 [G] sirjoot: :D
2014.05.13 18:32:39 [G] sirjoot: Or like they need Premium to be able to found a village
2014.05.13 18:32:56 [G] DLmass: :D
2014.05.13 18:33:12 [G] sirjoot: :D
2014.05.13 18:33:16 [G] sirjoot: Right, lets do this
2014.05.13 18:33:17 [G] DLmass: Keep the name MTI or change it to something awesomer?
2014.05.13 18:33:26 [G] sirjoot: Hmm
2014.05.13 18:33:38 [G] DLmass: RPGish or something
2014.05.13 18:33:45 [G] sirjoot: Well as we are changing the theme it seems pretty irrelivent
2014.05.13 18:33:51 [G] DLmass: ^^
2014.05.13 18:34:34 [G] sirjoot: "Founders RPG"?
2014.05.13 18:35:03 [G] DLmass: hmm
2014.05.13 18:37:46 [G] DLmass: Removed all the other founders, moderators.

2014.05.13 18:53:34 [G] sirjoot: Yeah, I guess
2014.05.13 18:53:43 [G] DLmass: That players can stay in-game in that zone and earn cash.
2014.05.13 18:54:22 [G] sirjoot: Right, when will it be on Windows?
2014.05.13 18:54:46 [G] DLmass: Probably in the end of the month. I need to let this server run out.
2014.05.13 18:54:57 [G] sirjoot: :o
